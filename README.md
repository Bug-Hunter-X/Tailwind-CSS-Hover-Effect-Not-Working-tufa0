# Tailwind CSS Hover Effect Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS hover effects. The hover state doesn't seem to work as expected, even after checking for common issues such as typos in class names or missing plugins. This issue was resolved by identifying a conflicting CSS rule.

## Bug Description

A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes to apply a hover effect is not responding to the hover action as expected.

## Solution

The bug was resolved by identifying a conflicting CSS rule. It was found that a higher-priority CSS rule was overriding the hover effect added by Tailwind CSS. The solution was to either remove the conflicting rule or increase the specificity of the Tailwind CSS class.
